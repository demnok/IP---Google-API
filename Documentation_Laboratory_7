GOOGLE PLACES API


1. Go to developers.google.com/places/documentation
   Select your development platform. In our case, we chose the google places API Web Services. 
   This API has the following services:
	1. Place Search (doc by ULI)
	2. Place Details
	3. Place Add
	4. Place Photos
	5. Place Autocomplete 
	6. Query Autocomplete
In order to use these functionalities, you have to get a private key, which can be obtained from developer.google.com/places/web-services/get-api-key;
For getting a key, you firstly have to complete a short formular, entering the name of your project and agreeing with the terms and conditions. 
Afterwards, you have to activate your key from Google Console. 
The management of the key is done by Google Console (upgrading the key to a premium one);
This has some further benefits: 
	Licences for asset tracking implementations;		
	Annual contracts with enterprise terms;
	24 hours technical support;
	Guaranteed ad-free and enhances API features;
Google also provides services as:
Invite Only(Intranets) && Asset Tracking

The key has a quota-> there can be limited the number of IP addresses that can use your API's key to send requests;
Key restrictions:
	To prevent unauthorized use and quota theft, restrict your key:
	HTTP referres
	IP addresses
	Android apps
	iOS apps

For requests, the key must be passed as a parameter. Example: 
https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/nearbysearch/json
